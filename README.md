# Programming Competitions Code Repository
Welcome to my repository of solutions for various programming competitions! This collection includes my implementations of algorithmic and data structure problems across a range of competitive programming platforms, including but not limited to Codeforces, Leetcode, and AtCoder. The code is organized by competition.
## Overview
This repository contains solutions to a variety of competitive programming problems. Each folder corresponds to a different competition or category, and each file contains a specific solution to a problem. All code is written in C++.
These questions center around 3 topics:
- **Algorithm design**: Optimizing solutions for performance and memory.
- **Data structures**: Efficient data storage and retrieval methods.
- **Math-heavy problems**: Leveraging mathematical insights to solve computational challenges.
